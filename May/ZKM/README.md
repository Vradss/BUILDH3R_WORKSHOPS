## 1. Define universal settlement?
It just refers to the irreversible finalisation of a transaction. This transaction once is executed cannot be reverted. 

## 2. Why is Universal Settlement important and how is ZKM achieving this?
Because it provides sureness that a transaction is immutable, generates confidence that the information will not be modified.  ZKM is using entangled rollups to accomplish and improve actual systems. 

## 3. What is an Entangled Rollup? Describe its capabilities
In a securely and trustlessly way, this allows transferring data between evm or not-evm using zkp. Its about enhancing interoperability between different blockchain networks, even if they are non compatible  or have different consensus mechanisms like proof of stake or pure proof of stake or whatever mechanisms it uses. 

## 4. How Does the Analogy of Quantum Entanglement Relate to ZKM's Quantum Network?
(Speaking of QM) When the state of one particle is measured, the state of its entangled counterpart instantaneously reflects the same state, no matter the distance between them. On the other hand, with ZKM Quantum Network, zkps enable allows that all data can maintain their equivalence and connection regardless of their placement on different blockchains.

## 5. Elaborate on the Advantages that ZKM's Quantum Network offers.
Interoperability between incompatible or isolated blockchains even if they don’t share same infra.

Trustlessness, ZKM allows avoid external third-party validators.  

Native liquidity across isolated chains, for example any funds that a user deposits into an L1 within the quantum network would can be used across all the L2 within this network and users can also withdraw to any L1 they want.

# ZKM_UseCase

**Use Case for ZKM Submited in Discord ✅**

GM everyone!

I would like to take advantage of ZKM and its main attraction, from my point of view: interoperability adding the privacy preservation capabilities through zk proofs, I think it could revolutionize the concept of social networks by allowing access from all chains of blocks. This use case focuses on improving the user experience.

By allowing the transfer of assets like tokens and NFTs between different blockchain-based social media platforms, users can access and use dapps on multiple chains, I would add the use of account abstraction so they don't even have to worry about understanding that they are operating on blockchain networks. I mean... we all use the Internet, but do users know what a TCP/IP protocol is? We owe them the same with blockchain.

Overall, ZKM could provide global access to users to the social networks of the future, it has a lot of potential to offer a fluid and secure way to connect and interact through blockchain, and above all, to improve the UX that complicates onboarding and mass adoption today.
